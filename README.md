# Tip Request

_Tip Request_ was created as a way to allow users to track food purchases they have made, all with a built-in tip calculator. With the integrated Google sign-in, you can view your history of past transactions across different devices. The history is all saved with Google Firebase. Quick Tip is where you can calculate tips on the go and subsequently add them to your history of past transactions if you please. The ability to search for dining establishments using the Google Maps API gives user the ability to save spots and view them on a map.
